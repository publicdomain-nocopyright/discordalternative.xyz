### Proposal: Guild List
**Leaving Index page for major servers/guilds only.**  

`guild-list.html` - might be used to list all the other guilds\servers.  
It could be accessed from Index page - Right side of the main Guild.  
On the right side there would be a link that says "See more Guilds."  

**Pros:** the Index page is not overwhelmed with lots of servers.  
**Cons:** index page is less functional: requires one more click to reveal the rest of the guilds/servers.
